Description: This dataset was collected using a new four-arm within-study comparison design. The study aimed to examine the impact of a mathematics training intervention and a vocabulary study session on post-test scores in mathematics and vocabulary, respectively. The innovative four-arm within-study comparison design facilitates both experimental and quasi-experimental identification of average causal effects.
