#' MSC Dataset
#'
#' This dataset contains measurements of confidence in understanding and ability to
#' simplify algebraic expressions involving exponents. The 5-point Likert-type items
#' were developed by Keller et al. (...) and administered to 2,200 Amazon Mechanical
#' Turk workers. The dataset includes Math Confidence Scale (MCS) measurements taken before
#' and after a math training intervention. The final variable, named 'type', indicates whether
#' the data were collected before or after the intervention.

#' @docType data
#' @format MSC_WSC is a data frame with 2200 cases (rows) and 7 variables (columns).
#' The variables are named item1, item2 ...., iteme6, and type.
#'\itemize{
#' \item I understand the meaning of a factor in an algebraic expression.
#' \item I understand the difference between a base and an expression in an algebraic expression.
#' \item I can simplify algebraic expressions that involve multiplying exponential expressions with the same base.
#' \item I can simplify algebraic expressions that involve dividing exponential expressions with the same base.
#' \item I can simplify algebraic expressions that involve raising an expression to a power.
#' \item I can simplify algebraic expressions that involve negative exponents.
